# Fix for Google Safe Browsing Warning

## Why This Happens
Google Safe Browsing is flagging your site because it loads images from imgur.com. Imgur has been used to host malicious content in the past, so sites that load resources from imgur are sometimes flagged as potentially dangerous.

## Solutions (in order of recommendation)

### 1. Host Images on Vercel (Recommended)
Move all images to your project's `public` folder and serve them from your domain:
- Create a folder: `/apps/app/public/images/`
- Download all imgur images and place them there
- Update all image URLs from `https://i.imgur.com/...` to `/images/...`

### 2. Use a CDN Service
Use a reputable CDN like:
- Cloudinary
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Vercel's built-in image optimization

### 3. Use Next.js Image Optimization
Configure Next.js to optimize and serve external images:
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['i.imgur.com'],
  },
}
```

### 4. Report False Positive to Google
Visit: https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_error/
Report your site as incorrectly flagged.

## Immediate Actions
1. **Most Important**: Move images to your project
2. Deploy the changes
3. Request a review from Google Safe Browsing
4. The warning should clear within 24-72 hours

## Code Locations to Update
All imgur URLs are in:
- `/apps/app/src/app/page.tsx` (student photos and background)
- `/apps/app/src/app/layout.tsx` (favicon)

Total: ~20 imgur URLs that need to be replaced.
