# Image Migration Complete

## What Was Done

1. **Created local images folder**: `/apps/app/public/images/`
2. **Downloaded all 19 images** from imgur to local storage
3. **Updated all image references** in the code:
   - 16 student photos in `page.tsx`
   - 1 logo image in `page.tsx`
   - 1 background image in `page.tsx`
   - 3 favicon references in `layout.tsx`

## Benefits

## Next Steps

1. **Commit these changes** to git

3. **Report false positive** to Google at: https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_error/
4. The security warning should clear within 24-72 hours
